# Cell-Count-Comparison
A Java Program that provides information about a user inputed motor and battery combination.

  Building and racing quadcopter drones is one of my hobbies. This racing season, MultiGP, the company that orgnizes drone races, changed their rules, allowing racers to use higher voltage batteires than the could previously. As a result, many pilots are switching to these higher voltage battery packs, as they have the potential to provide pilots with many advantages. While an increase in voltage has the potential to make a our drones go faster, many pilots are opting to use higher voltage batteries to achive longer, and more efficent flights, while keeping their drone's speeds relatively similar. With the increase in voltage limits, pilots are exprimenting with different motors that require less power (Wattage) to achive similar RPMs. This allows pilots to draw less amperage from their battereis, while keeping similar RPMs, resulting in longer time in the air. **The point of this program is to help pilots compare their existing motor and battery combonations with new potential cobonations, and aims to provide stastics about how two different setups wil theoritically compare.
